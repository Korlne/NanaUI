# KeepAlive

By default `when` tears down the branch that is not shown. `.keep_alive()` keeps it, along with its nodes and state, so it reappears exactly as it was when you switch back. List rows do not need this: `each` already keeps rows by key.

:::api

```rust view
use nana_ui::runtime::view;

view! {
    <KeepAlive>
        <TextInput v-if={editing} v-model={draft} />
        <Text v-else>{draft}</Text>
    </KeepAlive>
}
```

```rust rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::{text, text_input, when};

when(editing, || text_input().model(draft))
    .otherwise(|| text(draft))
    .keep_alive()
```

:::

`<KeepAlive>` wraps one `v-if` / `v-else-if` / `v-else` chain. Apart from `class`, it has no attributes. A hidden branch moves into a hidden `Stack` inside the container: it takes no part in layout, painting, or hit testing, and focus moves away. When the container is destroyed, the kept branches are destroyed with it.

Combined with `<Transition>`, a kept-alive branch plays no leave animation when switched away and plays its enter animation when switched back. See [Transition](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/guide/built-ins/transition.md).

## Keeping several pages by key

Tabs are not two branches, true and false. `dynamic(key, render)` shows one view per key, corresponding to Vue's `<component :is>`. `.keep_alive()` keeps the view for every previous key, and `.max(n)` keeps at most n that are not showing, dropping the one shown least recently first.

```rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::dynamic;

dynamic(tab, |tab| match tab {
    Tab::Notes => notes(),
    Tab::Preview => preview(),
})
.keep_alive()
.max(2)
```

The limit exists only in the function style. The template `<KeepAlive>` has no `max`. Wrapping a `v-for` is also an error: list rows are kept by their own keys, not by this chain.

A kept branch's scope is not reclaimed; its nodes sit in that hidden `Stack`. Switching back shows the original nodes.

`when(…).keep_alive()` keeps at most one branch that is not showing. `v-if` with `v-else` is exactly that one. When the chain also has `v-else-if`, branches that left earlier are dropped and only the most recently hidden one is kept. To keep several pages by key, use `dynamic`.

A class on `<KeepAlive class="panel">` lands on the container wrapping the chain. In the function style, write `.class` after `keep_alive()`.
