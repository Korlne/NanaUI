# Classes and styles

To arrange a row or a column, start with the `gap` of `column()` / `row()`. When you need to write CSS, the stylesheet is compiled at build time and is no longer parsed at runtime. `view!`, `css!` and `stylesheet!` all sit behind `view-macro`. The full set of properties is not listed here; see [Layout (CSS subset)](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/layout.md) and [Layout (Rust)](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/rust-layout.md).

A misspelled class name is a compile error on both sides.

:::api

```rust view
use nana_ui::runtime::view;
use nana_ui::runtime::view::IntoView;

fn todos(empty: nana_ui::runtime::view::Signal<bool>) -> impl IntoView {
    view! {
        <style>
            .todos { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 120ms ease-out; }
            .todos.empty { opacity: 0.6; }
        </style>
        <Column class="todos" class:empty={empty} gap=8>
            <Text>"Tasks"</Text>
        </Column>
    }
}
```

```rust rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::*;

stylesheet! {
    mod todo_styles;
    .todos { opacity: 1; transition: opacity 120ms ease-out; }
    .todos.empty { opacity: 0.6; }
}

fn todos(empty: Signal<bool>) -> impl IntoView {
    column()
        .gap(8)
        .class(todo_styles::todos)
        .class_when(todo_styles::empty, empty)
        .children(text("Tasks"))
}
```

:::

The `<style>` in a template goes first and compiles into one `Sheet`. `class="todos"` expands to `.class(…)`, and `class:empty={empty}` expands to `.class_when(…)`. `stylesheet!` generates a `Class` constant for every class, with `-` replaced by `_`, so `.empty` above is `todo_styles::empty`. The constants of `mod todo_styles;` are visible only to the parent module; write `pub mod` to make them public.

The classes of one element must come from the same table. A `transition` on a fixed class plays along the compositor track to the new value when a binding changes `opacity`, `transform`, `width`, `height` or `background`. Logical styles take the new value directly.

To write a few declarations for a single element, use `css!`, and put it before the other layout calls:

```rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::{column, css};

column().css(css! { padding: 12px; opacity: 0.8 })
```

Values that Rust lexing cannot write go in double quotes, such as `font-size: "1.5em"`. Build time strips the quotes before splicing.

::: warning
Mixing classes from two stylesheets on one element fails an assertion at runtime. Write conditional classes and fixed classes in the same `stylesheet!`.
:::

Build time cascades only class selectors, such as `.todos` and `.todos.empty`. Tags, ids, combinators, `:hover`, `@media` and `@keyframes` are not compiled in and produce a warning on that piece of CSS. The same goes for an unknown property. Do not assume "if it is in the stylesheet it will take effect".

Class rules inside `@container` blocks are compiled in too and apply by container size. Declare the container with `container-type` and `container-name`:

```css
.card { container-type: inline-size; container-name: card; }
@container card (max-width: 300px) { .row { height: 40px; } }
```

When `card` is no wider than 300px, the `.row` inside it is 40px high. Runtime measures the size, and crossing a breakpoint relays out only the affected nodes. A plain rule written later still overrides a container rule. One element follows one axis of one container at a time, with at most 16 breakpoints; beyond that a warning is raised on the element. `@container` cannot be written in `css!`. For the conditions you can write and the parts that are not supported, see [Layout (CSS subset)](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/layout.md).

The containers of `each` and `when` accept `.class`, `.class_when` and `.css` as well. In templates, wrap a `v-for` or a `v-if` chain in `<Block class="strip">`; the class goes to the container, not to each row. A row's or branch's own `class` stays on the row.

## Surfaces that follow the theme

Colors in a stylesheet are evaluated against the light theme at build time, and switching the installed `ThemeId` does not recompute them. To follow the theme, write semantic roles. Every element on a view has `.foreground`, `.background`, `.border` and `.radius`. The first three are `SemanticColorRole` and the radius is a `RadiusTier`. All of them can be bound.

:::api

```rust view
use nana_ui::runtime::view;
use nana_ui::runtime::{RadiusTier, SemanticColorRole};

view! {
    <Column gap=8 background={SemanticColorRole::Surface} radius={RadiusTier::Md}>
        <Text foreground={SemanticColorRole::Muted}>"Secondary note"</Text>
    </Column>
}
```

```rust rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::{column, text};
use nana_ui::runtime::{RadiusTier, SemanticColorRole};

column()
    .gap(8)
    .background(SemanticColorRole::Surface)
    .radius(RadiusTier::Md)
    .children(text("Secondary note").foreground(SemanticColorRole::Muted))
```

:::

`.border` writes only the border color. The width is in layout. With one of the two missing, no border is drawn. To write both at once on a component, use `NodeStyle::outline(role, width)` or `Stack::outline(role, width)`, see [Layout (Rust)](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/rust-layout.md).

The built-in `nana.light` and `nana.dark` themes provide two sets of preset tokens; an application can also register custom themes through `ThemeDefinition + ThemeRegistry`. The current choice is persisted as a `ThemeId`, and components depend only on semantic roles, never on theme names or appearance hints.

Card padding and the `Stack` presets (`row`, `column`, `fill_column`) are also in the Rust layout page. The page edge and the card interior are two separate boundaries, and the framework does not clear one because of the other by nesting.
