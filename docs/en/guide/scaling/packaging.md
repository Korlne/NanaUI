# Packaging

A release is one main process and one executable. Packaging adds no resident launcher and does not look for A/B directories. The packager does not invoke cargo. You build first, then package, then validate.

```text
cargo build --profile dist
        │
nana-packager package
        │
<out>/app/
        │
nana-packager validate --run --tamper-suite
```

Three pieces split the work: `nana-package` reads the manifest and `.nrpack` inside the application (through `nana-ui`'s `packaged-resources`, off by default); `nana-packager` is only a build tool, and applications must not depend on it; `nana-ui-core::packaged` handles `nana://res/` paths. `scripts/check-package-boundary.py` guards the boundary. External hosts can skip this packaging entirely.

## Install layout

Application code gets logical locations from `ApplicationPaths`; do not assemble `./runtime/...` yourself.

| Logical location | Windows / Linux | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application root | `App/` | `Name.app` |
| Executable | `App.exe` / `App` | `Contents/MacOS/App` |
| RuntimeBin | `runtime/bin` | `Contents/Frameworks` |
| RuntimeResources | `runtime/resources` | `Contents/Resources` |
| RuntimePlugins | `runtime/plugins` | `Contents/PlugIns` |
| RuntimeTools | `runtime/tools` | `Contents/Helpers` |
| RuntimeManifest | `runtime/manifest` | `Contents/Resources/manifest` |

The Windows root holds one EXE. Files that must sit next to it (such as `steam_api64.dll`) go in `platform.windows.root_exceptions`, with a reason. `backend = "portable"` writes `runtime/manifest/portable`, and writable data goes to `<root>/data`. Installed builds never write data, caches, logs or crash files into the install directory.

## Resource packs

`nana-package.toml` has `schema_version = 1`. Unknown fields are rejected. A field name containing secret, private, token, password or credential is an immediate error.

Content keys are read from the environment variable `NANA_CONTENT_KEY_<NAME>` (64 hex digits) or `--content-key-file NAME=PATH`. The publisher signing seed is read from `NANA_PUBLISHER_SIGNING_KEY` or `--signing-key-file PATH`. A key file inside the git worktree that holds the config is rejected.

Every file under `resources.root` goes into exactly one pack. Unclaimed files are not packaged. A file claimed twice, paths that differ only in case, `..`, backslashes or control characters are all errors. At runtime, lookups are routed by longest prefix to exactly one pack.

| class | Constraints |
| --- | --- |
| `early-splash` | Not encrypted, at most 1 MiB, no dependencies on other packs |
| `bootstrap-ui` | May be encrypted, only with `embedded` or `process-start` keys |
| `protected` | Ordinary application resources |

If `bootstrap-ui` uses an `after-bootstrap-ui` key, the result is `StartupKeyCycle`. `depends_on` may only point to the same class or an earlier one. `SplashLogo::packaged("nana://res/…")` reads the logo from the `early-splash` pack. The reader does not call `KeyProvider`; a pack over 4 MiB (`EARLY_SPLASH_MAX_PACK_BYTES`) yields `EarlySplashTooLarge` without reading the TOC. The 1 MiB limit is checked again against the TOC before reading data.

`.nrpack` is v1 little-endian: a 4096-byte header, one 16-byte-aligned extent per entry in the data area, and a TOC aligned to 4096. Blocks use zstd (the C library on the packaging side, `ruzstd` at runtime). Encryption is XChaCha20-Poly1305 with a random 192-bit nonce. The publisher signs the header and `package.json` with Ed25519; the application holds only the public key. Reading follows eight steps and stops at the first failure; it never decrypts to a temporary directory and never decrypts per frame. Keys held by the client itself only stop casual unpacking.

`--baseline` reuses unchanged ciphertext from the previous release. `--cache` reuses records by plaintext hash. Incrementing `generation` rebuilds the whole pack, and the report says `key_rotation: true`. CI that discards the previous `out/` or cache gets a new nonce for every block.

## Wiring it into the application

The identity macro leaves `NANA-IDENTITY-V1` in the binary. Invalid fields fail compilation. With `packaged-resources` enabled, `ResourcePackOptions` is exported from `nana_ui`, and `nana_package::TrustPolicy` is available through `nana_ui::nana_package`. `NanaApplication` does not depend on this feature.

```rust
let identity = nana_ui_platform::application_identity!(
    id: "dev.nana.fixture",
    name: "Nana Fixture",
    version: env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"),
    vendor: "Nana",
);
let _session = NanaApplication::builder(identity)
    .resource_packs(
        ResourcePackOptions::new()
            .keys(my_key_provider)
            .trust(nana_package::TrustPolicy::RequirePublisher(PINNED_KEY))
            .loose_root(concat!(env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR"), "/assets")),
    )
    .start();
```

Styles, `@font-face` and `url()` use `nana://res/ui/app.css`. During development, without a manifest, the same logical paths are read from `loose_root`. In installed and portable builds, a relative `url()` without an explicit base resolves against `runtime_resources`. Development and embedded hosts still resolve against the current working directory. Each pack is opened only when it is first looked up.

## Validation before release

```bash
nana-packager validate "out/app/Nana Fixture.app" --trust-key ed25519:… --run --tamper-suite \
    --env NANA_FIXTURE_CONTENT_KEY=…
```

It checks: the manifest signature (reported as not executed without `--trust-key`); signing adapter verification (currently always not executed); that the root holds only the executable, `runtime/` and registered exceptions; that file sizes and hashes match the manifest; the binary identity marker; that dependencies can be found by the loader; one read of every pack per the manifest; and that there are no updater files and no `NANA-UPDATER-V1`. `--run` launches the app in an unrelated directory with `NANA_PACKAGE_VALIDATE=1`; the app prints one line of JSON before opening a window and exits. `--tamper-suite` first runs an untouched control, then separately corrupts the manifest, the header, the TOC and the first real record, deletes a pack, and removes keys with `--tamper-drop-env`. When the application declares a packaged logo, it also reads it from the `early-splash` pack and checks the PNG header.

Platform signing rewrites the executable. For a signed package, add `--allow-resigned`; those hash changes are downgraded to warnings. `--run` can only run on a host of the same platform as the package.

The CLI also has `package`, `keygen content|publisher`, `inspect`, `delta OLD NEW` and `macos-app`. `macos-app` only produces an `.app` with no resource packs and no manifest.

Not yet available: platform signing adapters, installer backends, optional self-update, real-window Early Splash / UiReady in package validation, StaticAppPlan fingerprints, Android AssetManager, Linux FHS paths, paged TOC.

Fields, read order and every check are in [Packaging and distribution](../../reference/packaging.md).
