# TreeView

`TreeView` draws the stable nodes, expansion facts, and hierarchy you give it as disclosure rows. It does not read paths and does not watch the file system. Collapsed children are not projected.

## Basic usage

`TreeView::new(nodes)` takes `TreeNode<Arc<str>>`. Leaves use `TreeNode::leaf(id, label)`; branches use `TreeNode::branch(id, label, expanded, children)`. `.icon`, `.selected`, and `.disabled` are set on the node.

The tree's `.size` defaults to small. `.style` replaces the whole style and must come before builder calls that change layout. The control table has no `<TreeView>`.

```rust view
use nana_ui::runtime::view;
use nana_ui::runtime::{TreeNode, TreeView};

view! {
    <Widget
        of={TreeView::new([
            TreeNode::branch(
                "src".into(),
                "src",
                true,
                [TreeNode::leaf("main".into(), "main.rs").selected(true)],
            ),
            TreeNode::leaf("cargo".into(), "Cargo.toml"),
        ])}
    />
}
```

```rust rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::widget;
use nana_ui::runtime::{TreeNode, TreeView};

widget(TreeView::new([
    TreeNode::branch(
        "src".into(),
        "src",
        true,
        [TreeNode::leaf("main".into(), "main.rs").selected(true)],
    ),
    TreeNode::leaf("cargo".into(), "Cargo.toml"),
]))
```

The default width fills; the height is computed from the visible row count and padding. If you write a height yourself, that height is kept, which makes it easy to put the tree in a fixed viewport. Read the selected id with `selected_id`. Disabled nodes are never selected.

## Expansion and selection

`apply_event` lets the tree change expansion and selection itself: `Toggle` only flips a branch; `Select` selects a node that is not disabled and clears any other selection.

`navigate` moves over the visible rows according to `TreeNavigation`, then applies the resulting event. Visible rows are read from `visible_rows`, with depth recorded in `TreeRowData`.

## Multiple selection

`.multiple(true)` makes the tree maintain a selection set and one active item within it:

- Press a row: select only it.
- Ctrl (Cmd on macOS) + press: add the row to or remove it from the selection set.
- Shift + press: select every visible row from the anchor to this row.
- With focus on the tree, Shift + arrow keys / Home / End move the active item and extend the range.

Every change to the selection set emits `TreeSelectionChanged { selected, active }`, with `selected` in tree order. Single selection still emits `TreeViewEvent::Select`. `selected_ids` reads the selection set; `active_id` reads the active item.

## Toggle columns

`.columns([TreeToggleColumn::new(icon, name)])` draws a column of icon toggles at the end of each row, for example visible or locked. A row's toggle state is `TreeNode::toggles`:

- An icon that is on uses the secondary text color; one that is off uses a fainter color.
- Pressing a toggle flips it without changing the selection.
- Holding and dragging along the column over other rows sets every row to the same value.

Each change emits one `TreeToggleChanged { id, column, on }`. The tree updates the state on the node itself; if the application does not accept it, it writes the node back.

When some rows have no toggle in a given column (for example group rows in a layer tree have no visibility of their own), `.hide_toggle(column)` removes that cell and `.hide_toggles()` removes all of the row's toggles. A removed cell is not drawn and cannot be pressed; a drag along the column skips that row, and the screen reader does not report that toggle. Column indices stay the same, and other rows are unaffected.

## Drag and drop

With `.reorderable(true)`, a row can be dragged onto another row, with three kinds of drop target:

- Pointer in the top quarter of the target row: `Before`, drawing a line at the row's top edge.
- Pointer in the bottom quarter: `After`, drawing a line at the row's bottom edge.
- Pointer in the middle: `Inside`, outlining the whole row.

What is dragged is the selection set (when the drag starts from a selected row), otherwise just that row. No drop target is shown when the target is a dragged row itself or one of its descendants. Releasing emits `TreeDropRequested { rows, intent }`; the tree itself moves no nodes, and the application decides whether to accept. Dragging out of the tree and releasing emits `TreeDragReleased { rows, x, y }`, where `x` and `y` are window coordinates; the application can convert them into another control with `UiWorld::pointer_layout_position` to drop the rows into another list. Releasing an already selected row without dragging selects only that row.

## Inline rename

With `.renamable(true)`, double-clicking a row or pressing F2 on the focused tree opens an input at the label's position with the old name selected:

- Enter, or focus leaving the tree: emits `TreeRenameRequested { id, text }` and returns focus to the tree.
- Escape: cancels without an event.

The tree does not change the node's name; the application decides whether to accept. `renaming` reads the row being renamed. The manual calls are `begin_tree_rename` / `end_tree_rename`.

## Dragging in from a list

When dragging from a `ReorderList` onto the tree, what comes back is the stable node plus `before`, `inside`, or `after`. The tree does not infer whether it is a directory or a file.

## Accessibility

The tree is a Tree to the screen reader, named by `.label(name)`, for example "Layers" or "Outline". Without it the tree has no name; the tree never uses a row's id or label as its name.

Each visible row is a TreeItem under the tree. These rows are not retained nodes but virtual nodes projected from the visible rows, following expansion and selection live. Each row carries:

- Name: the row's label.
- Level: 1 at the top level, plus 1 for each level deeper.
- Expanded: only on branch rows, indicating expanded or collapsed.
- Selected: whether it is in the selection set.
- Disabled: rows of disabled nodes are disabled.

Collapsed child rows are not in the accessibility tree; they appear after expansion. While the tree has focus, the screen reader's focus is on the active row; with no active row it is on the tree itself.

The screen reader can perform these actions on rows, with the same results and the same events as pointer and keyboard:

- Click: same as clicking the row; selects only it and gives the tree focus.
- Focus: same as moving to the row with arrow keys; moves the active row here and gives the tree focus.
- Expand / collapse: branch rows only; same as clicking its triangle, emitting `TreeViewEvent::Toggle`.

Actions on disabled rows, on rows that no longer exist, and actions a row cannot perform (for example expanding a leaf, or expanding an already expanded branch) are rejected without an event.

### Toggle columns

Each toggle at the end of a row is a Checkbox under that row's TreeItem, also a virtual node, in column order. Each toggle carries:

- Name: the column name, the second argument of `TreeToggleColumn::new(icon, name)`, for example "Visible" or "Locked". The tree never uses the icon as the name, so the application must supply the column name and change it when the UI language changes; with an empty column name the toggle has no name.
- Checked: the toggle state for this row and column; off when the node does not set this column.
- Disabled: rows of disabled nodes have disabled toggles too.
- Bounds: the rectangle of the toggle icon within the row.

When toggle state changes (a press, a drag over, or the application writing the node back), the screen reader sees the new state immediately.

The screen reader can only click a toggle: the same as pressing it, which flips it and emits the same `TreeToggleChanged { id, column, on }`, and the tree updates the state on the node the same way. It does not change the selection or move focus. Disabled rows, rows that no longer exist, columns the tree does not have, and actions other than click are rejected without an event.
