# NativeMarkdown

`NativeMarkdown` parses CommonMark / GFM source into native blocks and shows them in the tree. While it has focus, copy takes its selection snapshot.

There is no `<NativeMarkdown>` in the control table.

## Basic usage

`NativeMarkdown::new()` is an empty document.

`NativeMarkdown::from_source(source)` and `NativeMarkdown::parse(source)` go through the same parse.

:::api

```rust view
use nana_ui::runtime::view;
use nana_ui::runtime::NativeMarkdown;

view! {
    <Widget of={NativeMarkdown::from_source("# Notes\n\nA paragraph of body text.")} />
}
```

```rust rust
use nana_ui::runtime::view::widget;
use nana_ui::runtime::NativeMarkdown;

widget(NativeMarkdown::from_source("# Notes\n\nA paragraph of body text."))
```

## Feature

This type is behind the Cargo feature `rich-text`.

`components` turns it on.

## Parsing

Parsing enables GFM, tables, strikethrough and task lists, and math delimiters too.

`from_blocks` takes `MarkdownBlock`s that are already split.

`blocks()` reads the parse result.

The source is kept in the control so you can read it again.

## Diagrams and formulas

Mermaid fences and formula fences are drawn by the control itself: formulas with RaTeX, diagrams with the native diagram engine (see [Native diagram engine](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/diagram-engine.md)), with colours following the theme.

Both kinds of fence also offer a presenter slot carrying the source. `MERMAID_PRESENTER` is `"mermaid"` and `MATH_PRESENTER` is `"math"`. A host that wants its own presentation can take over by this identity; the diagram slot also carries an accessible name and description.

Mermaid source it cannot read is shown as a code block. Tables, strikethrough and task lists go through native blocks.

## Assembly

`assemble_markdown` is a `slot_assembler`.

On view commit, and after reactive patches, it assembles the blocks into child nodes.

After placing components by hand with `create_component`, call it once yourself.

The write that changes a field does not reassemble automatically.

## Selection

Selection hangs off an internal `TextSelectionGroup` and is compared by identity, not by selection content.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | — | `from_source(source)` and `parse(source)` go through the same parse. The source is kept in the control. `new()` is an empty document |
| `blocks` | `MarkdownBlock` | `from_blocks` takes blocks that are already split. `blocks()` reads the parse result |

## Events

| Event | Payload | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | None | None |

## Slots

| Slot | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `mermaid` | `MERMAID_PRESENTER` is `"mermaid"`. The control already draws natively; the slot gives the source and the identity |
| `math` | `MATH_PRESENTER` is `"math"`. The control already draws natively; the slot gives the source and the identity |
