# Architecture Deep Dive

This section is for readers who **want to understand how the NanaUI framework is implemented and why its design choices were made**. It takes the repository apart by module (all 24 workspace crates) and by core subsystem (retained tree, layout, style, text, Scene extraction, GPU and frames, input, windows, toolchain), and drills down to source-level data structures and line-number anchors.

It divides the work with the other sections of the docs site as follows:

| Section | Perspective and audience |
| --- | --- |
| [Guide](/guide/introduction) | Getting started and going further as an application developer: building a window from scratch, reactivity, component composition, hot reload, packaging, and accessibility |
| [Components](/components/) | Catalog of the 71 built-in controls, usage examples (switchable between `view!` and functions), property tables, and event tables |
| [Architecture](/architecture/) | The mental model an application author needs (a frame, live GPU content, text, windows) |
| **Architecture Deep Dive (this section)** | For architecture learners and framework contributors: coverage of all 24 crates + subsystem internals + end-to-end data flow + verification checklists |
| [Reference](/reference/how-it-works) | Complete technical contracts for lookup (application API, declarative views, CSS/Rust layout, window/GPU/windowless output, maintainer notes) |

## The main path in one picture

```text
Rust / `.vue` dialect input
    -> nana-ui-core        shared contracts: Style Model, theme, geometry, Workspace, Motion IR
    -> nana-ui-runtime     UiWorld: retained tree, controls, layout, input, focus, Shell, Dock, AreaLayout
    -> nana-ui-scene       extracted retained drawing graph (no WGPU dependency)
    -> nana-ui             host adapter + SceneWgpuPainter
```

There is exactly one product rendering path: `UiWorld → ExtractedNode → UiScene → SceneWgpuPainter`. Each supporting engine (CSS engine, text engine, input contract, platform and window, GPU contract) has exactly one authoritative implementation in the repository. See [Modules and Layers](/learn/modules-and-layers) and [Contracts and Invariants](/learn/contracts-and-invariants).

| [Workspace: Shell, Workspace, Dock, and Overlay](/learn/workspace-shell-dock) | Desktop shell, region scaling, the recursive Dock tree, AreaLayout, same-transaction focus migration for overlays, and state persistence |

### Rendering and the host side

| Chapter | Core content |
| --- | --- |
| [Scene Extraction](/learn/scene-extraction) | `UiScene` drawing graph structure, `apply_delta` incremental invalidation, `FramePlan` compilation, why it does not depend on WGPU |
| [GPU and Frame Lifecycle](/learn/gpu-frame) | The `nana-gpu` contract, submission guard, frame slots, upload ring, `SceneWgpuPainter`, the 35-step total order of a frame |
| [Window and Platform](/learn/window-platform) | The neutral `nana-ui-platform` contract, native execution in `nana-window`, material fallback semantics, headless `WebSurface` |

### Authoring paths and toolchain

| Chapter | Core content |

| [Authoring Paths](/learn/authoring-paths) | How the Rust `view!` macro chain and the `.vue` dialect converge into the same `UiWorld` |
| [Authoring Toolchain](/learn/toolchain) | `view-macros` / `view-schema` / `view-codegen`, the `.vue` SFC compiler |
| [Supporting Crates at a Glance](/learn/supporting-crates) | Charts, diagnostics, SVG rasterization, icons, the read and write sides of packaging, hot reload, devtools, and the surrounding ecosystem |

### Appendix

## Three recommended reading routes

- **Start from the bird's-eye view**: [Modules and Layers](/learn/modules-and-layers) → [Contracts and Invariants](/learn/contracts-and-invariants) → pick the subsystem chapters that interest you → [End-to-End Data Flow](/learn/flows).
- **Start from rendering one frame**: [End-to-End Data Flow](/learn/flows) (Flow 1: state → pixels) → [Retained Tree](/learn/runtime-tree) → [Scene Extraction](/learn/scene-extraction) → [GPU and Frame Lifecycle](/learn/gpu-frame).
- **Start from a specific crate**: look up its responsibility and key entry types in the [24-Crate Coverage Matrix](/learn/coverage-matrix), jump to its owning chapter, then follow the data flow to see how it works with upstream and downstream crates.
