# Architecture Overview

This section is for **application authors**. It builds the core mental model you need to develop desktop products with NanaUI. For the complete boundary contracts between crates, see [Architecture contracts](../reference/architecture.md). To dig into each crate's internal sources and data flow, go to [Learn the architecture](/learn/).

## One product path

```text
Application state
    │  declarative view mount / signal bindings / host texture updates
    ▼
UiWorld          retained tree, style, layout, hit testing, focus and accessibility
    │  flush
    ▼
UiScene          retained drawing graph, independent of the graphics backend
    │  SceneWgpuPainter
    ▼
Host Surface     Window / Device / Queue owned by the application
```

Rust's `view!` macro, function views and the `.vue` dialect all build the same `UiWorld`. They are different authoring paths, not a second tree or a second painter. CSS parsing and cascade also have exactly one implementation, `nana-ui-css`: the `.vue` `<style>`, `stylesheet!` and `css!` call it at build time and compile to Style Model data.

The application owns business state, routing and the concrete content of each region. The framework provides control semantics, layout solving, hit testing, focus/IME, incremental accessibility projection, and the pipeline that paints the scene into the host Surface.

## Responsibilities by layer

| Crate | Core responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `nana-ui-core` | Shared foundation contracts: Style Model (Tokens + Semantics + Layout), theme tokens, geometry, WorkspaceModel, Motion IR |
| `nana-ui-runtime` | Retained tree authority `UiWorld`, built-in controls, layout engine, input routing, focus, Shell, Workspace, Dock, AreaLayout |
| `nana-ui-scene` | Drawing graph authority `UiScene` and `FramePlan` (depends on runtime, not on WGPU) |
| `nana-ui` | Host adapter, `run_runtime` and `SceneWgpuPainter` |
| `nana-ui-css` | The only stylesheet parse and cascade engine (stays out of core / runtime / scene / nana-ui) |
| `nana-text` | The product's only authority for text measurement, OpenType shaping and retained text layout |
| `nana-ui-input` | Canonical input events, sequencer and `HostServices` contract (the Runtime router is the only consumer) |
| `nana-gpu` | `GpuContext`, `FrameContext`, `GpuTexture` contracts (WGPU is the only official backend) |
| `nana-window` | Native window handles, system materials, title bar dragging, client-area chrome and scaling |

Ordinary controls never get a native window handle (`HWND` / `NSWindow`). System materials are requested through `nana-window`; on failure it truthfully returns the outcome that actually applied, or an explicit fallback. Your application owns the `Window`, the `Surface`, the `GpuContext` and each frame's `FrameContext`. Live GPU content hangs on the tree through `GpuTextureView` or `CustomRenderNode` and takes part in layout, clipping, hit testing and document order like any ordinary control.

## Logical state is separate from the presentation overlay

`UiWorld` stores **logical state** that business code can read, while transient opacity and transforms during transitions live in the presentation overlay of `PresentationStore`. When business code reads a node property it gets the logical target value. Painting, hit testing, focus and accessibility query the presentation value at the same timestamp when they need it.

::: warning
Never write a compositor animation's transient sample back into base style. That turns a mid-transition value into logical state, and it also dirties `UiWorld` every frame so the compositor can never reach a steady state.
:::

## What the framework deliberately does not include

NanaUI does not provide a whole-window browser DOM, a built-in business routing stack, or server-side rendering. Embedding a real web page inside the application is limited to the explicit host-native exception `BrowserView` (currently macOS `WKWebView`). Headless web capture is a host content producer (`WebSurface`) that outputs frames to the application. What goes into each workspace region and how navigation works are up to the application, which places that content into shell slots itself.
