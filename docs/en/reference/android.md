# Android experimental host

Android (`platform/android`) is the repository's **experimental ARM64 host path**. It is not a current product delivery target, and not a second product rendering core — do not write it into user-facing cross-platform promises.

The HarmonyOS / OpenHarmony build tier one step below it is [OHOS](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/ohos.md): it only promises that it compiles, and has no host in the repository.

On the Android host the UI also enters `nana-ui-runtime` (`UiWorld`) and `nana-ui-scene` (`UiScene`) and is painted by the same `SceneWgpuPainter`; the window and the Vulkan graphics device are held by the host's Android `Activity` (it does not call the desktop `run_runtime`).

## Window content

The whole Surface is one Runtime document, held by the [mobile host](https://github.com/sena-nana/NanaUI/blob/main/docs/reference/mobile-host.md) (`nana-mobile-host`); the iOS host uses the same layer. `GameActivity` lays the Surface under the status bar, the navigation bar and the soft keyboard. The document root fills the theme background color and keeps padding for the four insets (`WindowInsets` `systemBars | displayCutout` and `ime`); in landscape the notch and navigation bar on each side are avoided as well. Touches outside the primary window go to the system.

The window mounts the measurement page shared by both hosts (`nana-mobile-probe`). Android has no camera in the prototype; after turning on "CPU preview" the host generates and uploads 640×480 frames at 30 fps to measure the cost of the upload path.

The manifest's `configChanges` contains `uiMode|fontScale|density`; these changes do not recreate the Activity, and the light/dark mode and font size follow the system update.

## Frame scheduling and lifecycle

The host loop decides how to wait from `FrameDemand`:

- When frames are needed, every round produces a frame, rate-limited by the Fifo swapchain at vsync.
- With a deadline, `poll_events` sleeps until the deadline.
- When idle, `poll_events(None)` blocks until there is input, a lifecycle event, or a view task woken through `AndroidAppWaker`.

The 16 ms polling and the 500 ms heartbeat frame are gone.

The original plan was to align to vsync with `AChoreographer_postFrameCallback64`. But when `poll_events` in android-activity 0.6 meets the callback result returned by `ALooper_pollOnce`, it records one error and ignores it, printing an error log every frame, so the current swapchain rate limiting took its place. The latency optimization of aligning to the vsync start point is left for later.

`TerminateWindow` drops only the surface; the document, the state and the Device are all kept. The next `InitWindow` attaches a new surface with the same Device.

## Phase 2 platform contract (based on `GameActivity`)

Compared with the earlier `NativeActivity`, the current Android host is built on the `game-activity` feature of `android-activity` (`NanaActivity` inherits from `GameActivity`, which brings `InputConnection` and `GameTextInput`):

- **Input method (IME)**: composition updates map to `CompositionInput::Update`, commits to `Commit`, and delete-surrounding context to `DeleteSurrounding`; like touch and key events, the document's input source stamps them with a sequence number and they all go through `AppContext::route_input`, with no second Android text state machine. `EditorInfo` mirrors the `password` and `multiline` flags from the currently focused editor (`PlatformCapabilities::android_mvp().ime = true` only means that channel is connected; it is not the same as full desktop-level acceptance).
- **System clipboard**: `ClipboardHost` is implemented through JNI calls to the system `ClipboardManager` and wired into the Android branch of `default_shared_clipboard()`; the document's `HostServices` uses that backend through `read_shared_clipboard` / `write_shared_clipboard` (`clipboard = true`).
- **App data directory**: `app_data_dir` returns the sandbox's `Context.getFilesDir()` directly on Android (ignoring the `app_id` argument); the host opens it with `FileStore::open` and injects it, and the framework never writes to disk on its own.
- **Accessibility (TalkBack)**: with the `Click`, `Focus`, `SetValue` and `SetSelection` action projections wired in, `Button`, `Switch` and `TextInput` can be activated (`Click` on `TextInput` requests focus so the soft keyboard comes up; scrolling and virtual-list projections are left to a later phase).

## Cross-compiling and APK packaging

Local cross-compilation and the `nana-android-host --lib` unit tests that run on the desktop verify only the Rust-side action queue, the input/IME mapping and the accessibility projection contracts. They **cannot replace acceptance on a device for CJK IME candidate windows, the system clipboard or TalkBack touch exploration**.

```bash
# 1. Cross-compile check for ARM64 only: checks nana-ui-core, nana-ui-platform, nana-ui --lib, nana-mobile-host and nana-android-host in turn
./scripts/check-android-arm64.sh

# 2. Build the dist profile and package an installable APK (requires a configured Android NDK and the GameActivity 4.4.0 Gradle wrapper; do not enable prefab)
./scripts/check-android-arm64.sh --build --dist
./scripts/package-android-host-apk.sh
```

Build notes:
- Packaging an APK must use the `--dist` profile: a `dev` build embeds about `390 MB` of DWARF debug information and a `46 MB` symbol table in the `.so`, while `package-android-host-apk.sh` sets a `60 MiB` size limit on the stripped `.so`. The `.so` inside the APK is stored uncompressed together with `extractNativeLibs="false"`, so no second copy is unpacked after installation. More engineering details are in `platform/android/README.md`.

## Device acceptance checklist

After installing the APK on a device, check each of the following behaviours. On 2026-09-16 the first four passed on a Galaxy Z Fold4 with Android 16 (see #83), when the look page from before the move to the mobile host was still mounted; after the switch to the measurement page they need to be accepted again:

| Acceptance item | Expected behaviour | Evidence required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Soft keyboard show and hide** | Tapping the search field brings up the soft keyboard, and losing focus hides it; the bottom edge of the page rises with the IME inset to sit above the keyboard | Device or emulator |
| **System bar avoidance** | The top of the page is below the status bar, the bottom is above the navigation bar, and landscape avoids both sides; the theme background color shows beneath the system bars | Device, including notch / punch-hole screens |
| **Background and restore** | After going to the background and back, the text in the search field, the switches and the counter are all still there | Device or emulator |
| **No frames when idle** | Frames stop after interaction stops (the frame count in `adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo` stops growing) | Device |
| **Light/dark mode and font size** | Follows the system dark mode and system font size | Device |
| **CJK IME candidates** | Pinyin/stroke candidates are written correctly into the Runtime `TextInput` after selection (the host does not provide `CursorAnchorInfo` yet, so the candidate bar stays at the top of the keyboard) | **Must use a device IME**; `adb shell input keyevent` is not a substitute |
| **System clipboard interop** | Copy and paste inside `TextInput` interoperate with the system `ClipboardManager` | Device |
| **TalkBack screen reader interaction** | `Button` activation counts, `Switch` state toggling, `TextInput` focus and entry into editing | **A real person must perform TalkBack gestures on a device** (`adb`-injected taps bypass accessibility touch exploration) |
| **Touch scrolling** | The grid flings with `ScrollPhysics::Android`, stops at the edge, and does not overshoot | Device |
| **Accessibility for scrolling and virtual lists** | Android-side scroll accessibility actions are not wired in yet | Left to a later phase |
