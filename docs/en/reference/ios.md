# iOS Experimental Host

The iOS host (`platform/ios`) is an **experimental** host path. Like [Android](android.md), it is not a product delivery target. It shares the [mobile host](mobile-host.md) layer with Android.

## Structure

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `platform/ios/src/lib.rs` | `nana-ios-host`: an rlib that provides the host's C ABI (lifecycle, touch, frames, text proxy, accessibility), wrapping `MobileRuntime` and `MobileRenderer` |
| `platform/ios/include/nana_ios_host.h` | The shared C header. Every call is on the main thread; geometry is in physical pixels by default, and names containing logical are in logical pixels; text offsets are UTF-8 bytes |
| `platform/ios/Shell/NanaView.swift` | A view backed by `CAMetalLayer`: `CADisplayLink` pauses and resumes according to `FrameDemand` (up to 120 Hz on ProMotion); touches carry coalesced samples; light/dark and Dynamic Type are read from the trait collection; it detaches when entering the background; haptic feedback; VoiceOver container. `afterTick`, `onTick`, and `onIdle` are left to the app for laying out native layers and collecting frame statistics |
| `platform/ios/Shell/NanaTextProxy.swift` | Hybrid layer ①: a `UITextInput` text proxy, plus `UITextInteraction` |
| `platform/ios/probe/` | `nana-ios-probe`: the staticlib for the measurement page. It puts the measurement page into the host with `export_ios_app!` and carries its own `nana_probe_*` calls (`include/nana_ios_probe.h`) |
| `platform/ios/App/NanaProbe.xcodeproj` | The Swift shell for the measurement page. The "Build Rust host" build phase calls `build-rust.sh`, which builds the staticlib per platform and configuration (Debug uses `dev`, Release uses `dist`) |
| `App/NanaProbe/ProbeViewController.swift`, `ProbeCamera.swift` | Hybrid layer ③: a 640×480 front-camera `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` sits under the transparent surface, laid out at the position of the measurement page's preview area; it can also switch to the CPU upload path |
| `App/NanaProbe/ProbeMetrics.swift` | P50/P99 of frame interval and tick CPU time (logged every 240 frames), cold start to first frame, and signposts for Instruments |

### Building an app on the host

The host is an rlib; the Xcode target links only the app's own single staticlib:

1. Set the app crate to `crate-type = ["staticlib", "rlib"]` and depend on `nana-ios-host` and `nana-mobile-host`.
2. Implement `IosApp`:
   - `mount` mounts the app's view; the `Shell` passed in is used to request haptics (`Haptic`) and wake-ups;
   - `before_frame` runs before each frame is prepared, for example to update host textures.
3. Export `nana_ios_host_new` with `export_ios_app!(MyApp::new())`. The Swift shell's calls to `nana_ios_host_*` do not change.
4. The app's own C calls use `with_app::<MyApp, _>(host, |parts| ...)` to get the app, `MobileRuntime`, and `MobileRenderer`, and are declared in the app's own header (which includes `nana_ios_host.h`).
5. Xcode project:
   - reference the two Swift files in `Shell/`;
   - in the "Build Rust host" phase set `NANA_RUST_PACKAGE` and `NANA_RUST_LIB`, and also `NANA_CARGO_MANIFEST` when the crate is not in this repository;
   - link `-l<library name>` in `OTHER_LDFLAGS`.

### Accessibility

The host flattens the document's accessibility tree into the nodes VoiceOver stops on: nodes with a matching role, and nodes with a label.

- The shell calls `nana_ios_host_accessibility_count` to take a snapshot, then reads each node (role, state bits, logical-pixel frame, slider value) and its text (label, value, hint).
- Actions go through `nana_ios_host_accessibility_action`: activate, increment/decrement, and focus.
- `NanaView` turns these nodes into `UIAccessibilityElement`s; while VoiceOver is on, it posts `layoutChanged` whenever the node count changes.

## Text proxy

When an editor gains focus, the host notifies the shell through a callback. The shell places the proxy view over the editor, makes the proxy the first responder, and attaches `UITextInteraction(for: .editable)`. From then on, taps, long presses, and drags on the editor go to UIKit's text gestures.

| UIKit call | Host call |
| --- | --- |
| `setMarkedText` / `unmarkText` / `insertText` / `deleteBackward` | `set_marked_text` / `commit_text` / `delete_surrounding` |
| Setting `selectedTextRange` | `set_selection` |
| `caretRect(for:)` / `firstRect(for:)` / `selectionRects(for:)` | `text_caret_rect` |
| `closestPosition(to:)` | `text_offset_at` |

UIKit counts in UTF-16 offsets; the proxy converts to and from UTF-8 byte offsets. Callbacks run inside the host's input routing and cannot call back into the host synchronously, so the shell always dispatches them to the main queue first.

Known limitations:

- `UITextInteraction` draws its own caret and selection highlight while the NanaUI editor's caret is also drawn, so two carets appear. The prototype does not handle this.
- `selectionRects` is computed for a single line only.

## Building

`nana-ios-host` and `nana-ios-probe` are in the root workspace but have content only on `target_vendor = "apple"` (the condition under which wgpu provides `SurfaceTargetUnsafe::CoreAnimationLayer`); on Linux and Windows they compile as empty crates, and `cargo check --workspace` passes as usual. Check the iOS target itself with the scripts below.

```bash
# Cross-check (device target; --sim switches to the simulator target, which needs rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim first)
./scripts/check-ios-arm64.sh

# Build once without signing to confirm the project compiles and links
xcodebuild -project platform/ios/App/NanaProbe.xcodeproj -target NanaProbe \
  -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

To install on a device, select a Development Team for the NanaProbe target in Xcode, then run with the Release configuration. The Debug staticlib carries full DWARF and is hundreds of MB; do not use it to measure size or performance.

The shell uses the UIScene lifecycle (`SceneDelegate` creates the window; backgrounding is observed through `UIScene` notifications): an app built with the iOS 27 SDK that does not adopt the scene lifecycle fails at launch.

### Simulator

```bash
# Install the rustup target on the toolchain used for the build (NanaUI uses stable)
rustup +stable target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim
xcodebuild -project platform/ios/App/NanaProbe.xcodeproj -target NanaProbe \
  -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -arch arm64 CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- build
xcrun simctl install booted build/Debug-iphonesimulator/NanaProbe.app
# --console-pty connects the host's stderr (tick failures, panics) to the terminal
xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted dev.nana.probe
```

The simulator can verify functionality: first frame, touch scrolling and flinging, switches and sliders, Pinyin composition and candidate commit, backspace, going to the background and returning, light/dark switching, and no frames while idle. It cannot verify:

- **Camera**: the simulator has no camera; the preview layer stays black, and the CPU preview receives no frames.
- **Performance**: frame interval and CPU numbers do not count as evidence.
- **GPU capabilities**: the simulator's Metal offers only the Apple2 family, so wgpu provides only 15 inter-stage variables (31 on devices from A11 onward). Scene shaders are written to the limit of 15, so they also run on the simulator; keep to this limit when adding shader outputs.

## Acceptance

All of the following must be compared back to back on a real device against a minimal SwiftUI control app (the same grid, plus `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer`). Simulator numbers do not count as evidence.

| Item | Target | How to measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cold start to first frame | ≤ 500 ms | `first frame` log (counted from process start) |
| Frame interval while flinging the grid | P99 ≤ 8.3 ms at 120 Hz | `frames=… interval p99` log, plus Instruments Animation Hitches |
| Idle | CPU about 0 over 10 seconds, no ticks | Xcode CPU gauge; no new frame statistics in the log |
| First-effect hitches | No frame over 16 ms when first entering a page or when each effect first appears | `tick` durations in signposts |
| Preview power | Native preview layer, NanaUI underlay preview, and CPU upload, each run for 10 minutes to compare power and temperature | Xcode Energy gauge, Instruments Power Profiler |
| Size | Record the IPA increase | Release archive |
| Feel | Chinese IME composition, long-press selection, the magnifier, and the edit menu all work; scrolling and bounce compared side by side with the SwiftUI version | Manual operation |

Touch-drag scrolling of the grid uses Runtime touch scrolling, and the iOS host selects `ScrollPhysics::Ios`: deceleration by 0.998 per millisecond, rubber banding when dragged past an edge, and a bounce back on release. The contract is in [runtime-scene.md](runtime-scene.md#touch-scrolling-and-scrollphysics). What must be compared side by side with the SwiftUI version for feel: how far a fling travels before stopping, the strength of the bounce, and the 8-logical-pixel slop from press to scroll start.
