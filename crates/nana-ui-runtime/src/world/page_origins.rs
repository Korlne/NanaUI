//! Page origins remembered for one read-only pass.
//!
//! A box's page origin is its frames' local origins summed from the top down
//! ([`UiWorld::record_layout_origin`]), O(depth). Extraction and the
//! accessibility projection read it for every node they touch, so a subtree
//! mounted deep in the page paid its depth once per node: a chain of `n`
//! boxes cost `n²` additions. While a pass holds a [`PageOriginScope`], a
//! deep box's walk stops at the first frame it already summed and adds its
//! own locals onto that: summing from the top down, the frame's origin is
//! the running sum at that frame, so the result is the bit a full walk gives.
//! The scope borrows the world, so nothing writes a box while it is open.
