//! A paragraph that only moves keeps everything under it.
//!
//! A page of block paragraphs, each an inline formatting context of text
//! runs and an inline-block atom, under a header whose height the edits
//! change: every paragraph below it moves and none changes. Its line boxes
//! and runs are measured from its own origin, so the pass writes its box and
//! leaves its subtree as it was (`placement::keeps_moved_subtree`), instead
//! of packing its line boxes again. Some paragraphs also hold an
//! out-of-flow child: one whose static position hangs from the page, one hung
//! from a positioned ancestor by its insets, a fixed one, and one whose
//! containing block is the paragraph itself. The ones whose child reads
//! where the paragraph stands keep their body.
//!
//! Every step is compared with the same inputs laid out cold
//! (`assert_matches_cold`), and the per-pass guard requires every box under
//! a kept subtree to be the full layout's to the bit
//! (`verify::note_kept_subtree`).
