//! A subtree mounted deep in a laid-out page: the frame after it reads up
//! the chain above every node it touches -- page origins in extraction and
//! accessibility, the hit index's shifts, depths and pointer events, layout's
//! islands, accessibility's chain answers. Each pass walks that chain once,
//! not once per node: its steps grow with the nodes plus the depth, not
//! their product. What the passes produce is checked against the full walks
//! as they run (the remembered answers assert the bit a walk gives).
