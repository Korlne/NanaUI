//! What a restyle learns from comparing two resolved layouts, remembered by
//! the pair of `Arc`s.
//!
//! Layouts are interned (`LayoutInterner`), so nodes built alike hold the
//! same `Arc`, and every new node starts from the shared default: creating a
//! page of rows compares the same two layouts once per node. The answer is a
//! pure function of the two layouts, so a pair seen recently answers from
//! here. The memo holds both `Arc`s, which keeps their addresses from being
//! reused and their contents from being written in place (`Arc::make_mut`
//! copies a shared layout), so a pointer match is a match by value.
