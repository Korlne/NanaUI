//! How a node stands to the coordinate spaces around it, classified once.
//!
//! Every consumer that keeps what a moved box holds in that box's
//! coordinates -- hit entries, accessible bounds, extracted records -- has
//! to know the same few things of each box: what layout measures it from,
//! whether its own transform only moves it, scales it upright or turns it,
//! whether it opens a 3D context, whether it cuts what it holds, and whether
//! its visual places anything from the page. [`NodeSpace`] is that answer,
//! computed from the node's own record and visual by [`NodeSpace::of`] and
//! kept on [`crate::store::NodeRecord::space`]. [`crate::store::NodeStore`]
//! brings it up to date wherever a field it reads is written
//! (`note_node_space`): style resolution, a write of the layout frame, a
//! visual, an insert. Readers derive what they need from it -- hit testing,
//! accessibility, extraction -- and add what only their chain knows (the
//! transforms above, a hit parent, a scroll).
//!
//! Only what a node's own record decides is here: nothing that a change
//! above it could alter, so no write needs to visit a subtree.
